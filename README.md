AWK It! - interactive AWK completion in Emacs

AWK It! allows you to see AWK output as you are typing the script; it sends selected region to awk and uses yasnippet as interactive UI.

Features:
  - 3 AWK modes:
    - simplified - simple text syntax with field variables
    - single line - regular AWK syntax but only the part inside the default match
    - raw - full (regular) AWK script
  - custom field and line separators
  - processing with AWK from files
  - customizable
